	You will be given an array and a limit value.
	You must check that all values in the array are below or equal to the limit value.
	If they are, return true. Else, return false.

	Implement the DNA replication logic, which involves creating a complementary strand for the given DNA sequence.
	Use the following base pairing rules:

	'A' pairs with 'T'
	'T' pairs with 'A'
	'C' pairs with 'G'
	'G' pairs with 'C'

	Output Complementary DNA Strand: Display the resulting complementary DNA strand formed during replication.

    Given a string, capitalize the letters that occupy even indexes and odd indexes separately,

    For example, capitalize("abcdef") = ['AbCdEf', 'aBcDeF']. See test cases for more examples.

    The input will be a lowercase string with no spaces.

    Your task is to find the first element of an array that is not consecutive.
    By not consecutive we mean not exactly 1 larger than the previous element of the array.

    E.g. If we have an array [1,2,3,4,6,7,8] then 1 then 2 then 3 then 4 are all consecutive but 6 is not,
    so that's the first non-consecutive number.

    If the whole array is consecutive then return null.

    The array will always have at least 2 elements1 and all elements will be numbers.
    The numbers will also all be unique and in ascending order.
    The numbers could be positive or negative and the first non-consecutive could be either too!
