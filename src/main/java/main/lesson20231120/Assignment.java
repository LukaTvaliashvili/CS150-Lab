    Write a method that expects an argument of type integer and "Positive", "Negative", and "Zero" otherwise.
    Using this method check if the members of the given array, are positive, negative, or zero. Return a new array
    containing these values.

    Create a method that calculates the value of a base raised to a positive integer exponent.

	DNA is composed of Adenine ('A'), Guanine ('G'), Thymine ('T'), and Cytosine ('C').
	RNA differs slightly from DNA when it comes to the chemical structure and does not contain Thymine.
	In RNA Thymine is replaced by another nucleic acid Uracil ('U').

	Create a function which translates a given DNA string into RNA, assume that input is a valid DNA string.

	For example:
	"GCAT"  ->  "GCAU"
	"ATCGTACGATCG" -> AUCGUACGAUCG

	Given an array of integers, determine whether the sum of its elements is odd or even.
	Return your answer as a string "odd" or "even".
	If the input array is empty consider it as: [0] (array with a zero).

	Examples:
	Input: [0]
	Output: "even"

	Input: [2, 5, 10]
	Output: "odd"

	Input: [0, -1, -5]
	Output: "even"

	Given two strings, a and b, create a bigger string made of the first char of a, the first char of b,
	the second char of a, the second char of b, and so on. Any leftover chars go at the end of the result.

	shuffledString("abc", "xyz") → "axbycz"
	shuffledString("Hi", "There") → "HTihere"
	shuffledString("xxxx", "There") → "xTxhxexre"
