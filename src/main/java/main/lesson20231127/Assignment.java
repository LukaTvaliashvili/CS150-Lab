	Determine, whether a given year is a leap year or not.
	The rules are as follows:

	Years divisible by 4 are leap years,
	but years divisible by 100 are not leap years,
	but years divisible by 400 are leap years.

	isLeapYear(2000) -> true

	You will be given an array and a limit value.
	You must check that all values in the array are below or equal to the limit value.
	If they are, return true. Else, return false.
	You can assume all values in the array are numbers.

	In a small town the population is initial = 1000 at the beginning of a year.
	The population regularly increases by 2 percent per year and moreover 50 new inhabitants per year come to live in the town.
	How many years does the town need to see its population greater than or equal to target = 1200 inhabitants?

	example:
	calcYearsToTargetPopulation(1500, 5, 100, 5000) -> 15

	Method signature should be as follows:

	public static int calcYearsToTargetPopulation(int initial, double percent, int newInhabitants, int target) {}

	Given a string indicating a range of letters, return a string which includes all the letters in that range, including the last letter.
	Note that if the range is given in capital letters, return the string in capitals also!
